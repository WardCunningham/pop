  <p id="heading_id_3"><span class="sgc-1">You are a developer on an agile team. You need to work closely with the other developers.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="sgc-2">???</p>

  <p><i>To achieve</i> <b class="sgc-3">Collective Ownership</b> <i>and enable</i> <b class="sgc-3">Contstant Refactoring</b><i>, the structure, look, and feel of the code needs to be clear to every developer</i>.</p>

  <p class="sgc-2"><img alt="" src="../Images/Forces.png" /></p>

  <p>• Even small irritants can add to frustration.</p>

  <p>• On an agile team, even more than in other cases, the code is read frequently by many people.</p>

  <p class="sgc-2">! ! !</p>

  <p><b>Therefore</b>, <i>adopt a common coding style that everyone agrees to use consistently.</i></p>

  <p>• The details of the style matter less than the agreement and discipline to use it.</p>

  <p>• Tools can help.</p>

  <p>• Naming styles and conventions are a part of this. <b>Pair Programming</b> will help you keep to a style.</p>
