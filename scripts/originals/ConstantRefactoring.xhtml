  <h3 id="heading_id_2">Constant Refactoring</h3>

  <p>You are a developer on an agile team. You are implementing some functionality (a story) and realize that it will be difficult to do, given the current code-base.</p>

  <p class="sgc-1">???</p>

  <p>Since you haven't had all the requirements at the beginning, you don't have an overall architecture or design. <i>The code can become a hodge-podge if it isn't carefully managed</i>.</p>

  <p class="sgc-1"><img alt="" src="../Images/Forces.png" /></p>

  <p>•&nbsp;You want clean code and a good design, given what you know now.&nbsp;<br /></p>

  <p>• If the code is clean and an incremental change is small it shouldn't take a lot to cleanly integrate them, leaving the code clean. But it does take discipline.</p>

  <p>• If the code is messy then any change is likely to leave it messy.</p>

  <p class="sgc-1">! ! !</p>

  <p><b>Therefore</b>, <i>continuously improve the &nbsp;structure of the code as you go</i>.</p>

  <p>• Sometimes the easiest way to implement a story is to spend some time changing the existing code so that the new story fits more cleanly into it.</p>

  <p>• If the project has to make a radical change of direction you will have high cost here, but this is because of the new requirements, not that you didn't anticipate them in an early design.</p>

  <p>• Design patterns are a good place to look for refactoring advice and guidance. See Kerievsky[13], for example.</p>

  <p>• If you find velocity decreasing (<b>Yesterday's Weather</b>) it is probably time to spend extra effort on refactoring. You may need to apply a <b>Flexible Velocity</b> to achieve this. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
