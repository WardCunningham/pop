  <h3 id="heading_id_5">Retrospective</h3>

  <p>You are a member of an agile team. It is the end of an iteration.</p>

  <p class="sgc-1">???</p>

  <p class="sgc-2">You may need to change the process, but it might not be obvious. You want to know if the process you use is working well for you or not.</p>

  <p class="sgc-1"><img alt="" src="../Images/Forces.png" /></p>

  <p>• When there is a problem, individuals may have only separate pieces of the puzzle.</p>

  <p>• Without a clear end-to-end plan, as is typical in agile development, you need to run the project on a constant feedback stream.</p>

  <p>• You also need to assure you keep doing the good things that are making your project a success. You want to "turn the knobs up" on the things that work.</p>

  <p>• The team itself likely has the knowledge of what is working and what not, but you need a way to elicit this information in a safe, forward looking, manner.</p>

  <p>• Different members of the team may have different ideas about what works and what doesn't.</p>

  <p class="sgc-1">! ! !</p>

  <p><b>Therefore</b>, <i>hold a formal retrospective[14] to determine (a) what went well and should be repeated and (b) what caused difficulties and how you should change practices to do better.</i>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>• Important times to hold Retrospectives are at the end of the first iteration, the end of each release, and whenever the <b>Stand Up Meeting</b> reveals serious problems.</p>

  <p>• The first few Retrospectives you do should have the assistance of a trained facilitator and require at least a day.</p>

  <p>• Everyone needs to know from the beginning that part of the job is to be evaluative of the effectiveness of the practices.</p>

  <p>• Retrospectives need to include the <b>Whole Team</b>.</p>

  <p>• Retrospectives don't assign blame when things go wrong. Everyone needs to take responsibility.</p>

  <p>• Retrospectives don't directly <b>Deliver Customer Value</b>, so they need to be kept short and goal directed. If you hold them frequently, they can take as little as an hour.</p>

  <p>• Hold a longer Retrospective at the end of the project, of course, so that you don't lose the important lessons. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>• The Respective gives advice to the <b>Whole Team</b>, not the managers. You have a <b>Self-Organizing Team</b>, after all.</p>
