  <p>&nbsp;You are the customer on an agile project. Development is progressing, or perhaps has just begun.</p>

  <p class="sgc-1">???</p>

  <p><i>Without comprehensive requirements documentation, the agile developers need a source of "just in time" requirements</i>.</p>

  <p class="sgc-1"><img alt="" src="../Images/Forces.png" /></p>

  <p>• Agile projects don't develop all requirements at the beginning. These are gathered just in time to support their development.</p>

  <p>• The developers need a pipeline to the stakeholders to get their questions answered as they arise. There will be a lot of questions since there are no comprehensive requirements documents.</p>

  <p>• The developers need to work efficiently and not be cast into turmoil by hearing conflicting demands from the, possibly many, stakeholders.</p>

  <p>• Any communication distance between the you and the developers will lead to increased cost and the wrong thing being built.</p>

  <p>•&nbsp;Developers will make unfortunate assumptions when their progress is blocked for lack of information. This is unfortunate, but too true.&nbsp;<br /></p>

  <p>• The developers should make no business decisions at all. They have no control over what is to be built.</p>

  <p class="sgc-1">! ! !</p>

  <p><b>Therefore</b>, <i>stay immediately available to the team to develop stories and&nbsp;<b>Acceptance Tests</b>, and to answer the many questions that the developers will have</i>. XP describes the customer as being continuously onsite with the rest of the team: working in the same room.</p>

  <p>• The customer role is very demanding. It is easily the most demanding agile role.</p>

  <p>• The developers have a source for answers, but you will find it difficult to do much else than serve the team. You may need a support staff to help with this job [16].</p>

  <p>• In particular, the team will depend on you for executable Acceptance Tests and you may need help in creating these (<b>Customer-Tester Pair</b>).</p>

  <p>• You are the sole determiner of what will be built in the project, and when it will be built, but of course, you must interact with the rest of the stakeholders to determine this.</p>

  <p>• Your job is made harder so that the developers never have to slow down while disagreements play out.</p>

  <p>• You need to be empowered by your organization to make all of the business decisions for the project: budget, features, business value, etc.</p>

  <p>• Choosing the right customer can be a difficult task. The person chosen may need training in the task.</p>

  <p>The customer takes a lead role in the <b>Planning Game</b>, developing <b>Stories</b>, and choosing those of high value for the next iteration and the next release. The product backlog needs to be kept in approximate value order. You can re-prioritize this at any time that you have new information.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>It is useful to think of agile development as two funnels joined at the narrow ends. The stakeholders sit on one side and the developers on the other with the customer at the narrow part. All communication between developers and stakeholders is filtered through the customer.</p>
