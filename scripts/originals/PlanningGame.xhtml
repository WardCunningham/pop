  <p>You are a member of an agile team. An iteration (sprint) is about to begin. You need to decide what to do in this iteration.</p>

  <p class="sgc-1">???</p>

  <p class="sgc-2">The customer needs a chance to look at recent events and current needs and to re-steer the project. If you continue on the wrong path for long, you will fail.</p>

  <p class="sgc-1"><img alt="" src="../Images/Forces.png" /></p>

  <p>• You want to permit rapid re-targeting of the project. Business needs change.</p>

  <p>• You don't want day-to-day flux to introduce chaos into the work.</p>

  <p>• You want guidance from the customer, but not micromanagement.</p>

  <p>• The stories have to get estimated</p>

  <p>• The stories need to get selected for an iteration.</p>

  <p>• If you fail to plan, you plan to fail. (Wisdom from "Planned Development" but no less relevant to agile development. &nbsp;</p>

  <p class="sgc-1">! ! !</p>

  <p><b>Therefore</b>, <i>set aside one day a month (perhaps distributed over shorter iterations) to plan the next iteration and/or release</i>.</p>

  <p>• This should often include a <b>Retrospective</b> of the previous cycle.</p>

  <p>• Within an iteration the work plan is fixed, though things known to have become obsolete are dropped. Work isn't added unless the team runs out of work.</p>

  <p>•&nbsp;Developers will <b>Ask For More</b> if they find they have additional time.&nbsp;<br /></p>

  <p>• Arbitrary changes of direction are permitted (welcomed) at the Planning Game points.</p>

  <p>• The Planning Game is held once per iteration, whatever the length.</p>

  <p>• If release cycles are longer than iteration cycles, planning for release is also done in the Planning Game.</p>

  <p>Scrum plays the Planning Game once a month, XP every week or two. In both it is a time-boxed activity, since you want to <b>Deliver Customer Value</b>. Since the interval is longer, the <b>ScrumMaster</b> might, on occasion, need to declare premature end to a sprint, especially when changes to business plans make current work foolish. This is less likely in XP with shorter iterations. In any case it is a rare occurrence. A new Planning Game will then begin a new cycle, perhaps after a Retrospective.</p>
