  <h3 id="heading_id_2">Sustainable Pace</h3>

  <p>You are any member of an agile team, but primarily the Manager.</p>

  <p class="sgc-1">???</p>

  <p><i>You want your team to be effective for the long haul, months after month</i>. Pushing the team too much on schedule may seem like a good thing, but it will cost you in the long term.</p>

  <p class="sgc-1"><img alt="" src="../Images/Forces.png" /></p>

  <p>•&nbsp;When people are tired they seldom produce their <b>Best Efforts</b></p>

  <p>•&nbsp;Development is intellectual work. Your head needs to be clear to do it.</p>

  <p>•&nbsp;Exhausted people often don't behave well.</p>

  <p>•&nbsp;People want to give their best and will work hard without goading.</p>

  <p>•&nbsp;Over specifying is counterproductive and nearly always fails.</p>

  <p class="sgc-1">! ! !</p>

  <p><b>Therefore</b>, <i>pace the team for the long haul, not a sprint.</i> You want everyone working in top form all the time</p>

  <p>• An occasional burst of overtime is ok, but don't expect that it can continue without degradation of the team and its product. But a stable velocity is your best tool for projecting.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>See <b>Energized Work</b> for more on this. In fact there has been an evolution here. These ideas were originally captured in the idea of a <i>40-Hour Week&nbsp;</i>[2]. This morphed into the ideas expressed here. The best formulation is in <b>Energized Work</b>.</p>
