  <p>&nbsp;You are a developer on an agile team. You want to change some existing code to facilitate your current work.</p>

  <p class="sgc-1">???</p>

  <p>The code on a project is a company resource, but individuals come and go. <i>You need to assure that more than one person is familiar with every part of the code base</i>.</p>

  <p class="sgc-1"><img alt="" src="../Images/Forces.png" /></p>

  <p>• Developers don't like to get stuck waiting for others to act.&nbsp;<br /></p>

  <p>•&nbsp;Strong egos can get in the way of cooperative work.</p>

  <p>• If knowledge is closely held in the minds of single individuals, the enterprise is at risk if the individuals should leave for any reason.</p>

  <p>• An organization in which an individual's only security is what they know that the person in the next cubicle doesn't, is dysfunctional.</p>

  <p class="sgc-1">! ! !</p>

  <p><b>Therefore</b>, <i>assume that all code is commonly held</i>. If you need to change something to progress, go ahead and change it. No permission is needed from the originator.</p>

  <p>• A consequence for management is that code tracking to individuals is impossible. The team is responsible for its code, not the individual.</p>

  <p>• Collective Ownership leads to collective reward. This strengthens teams, but is foreign to some organizations. See <b>Collective Responsibility</b>.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>• Another consequence is that individuals are pushed in the direction of being generalists, rather than specialists.</p>

  <p>• This requires a common <b>Coding Standard</b>, of course.&nbsp;<br /></p>
